Some or all data, models, or code that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Here, we present the main model codes for reviewers.

The file named 'LPC.py' is the LCP-based leakage detection models using raw datasets.
The file named 'LPC_noise.py' is the LCP-based leakage detection models using -5dB datasets.
The file named 'LPC.py' is the LPC-based leakage detectio models using raw datasets.
The file named 'LPC_noise.py' is the LPC-based leakage detection models using -5dB datasets.
The file named 'Time or frequency features.py' is the time or frequency features-based leakage detection models using raw datasets.
The file named 'Time or frequency features_noise.py' is the time or frequency features-based leakage detection models using -5dB datasets.

The detection models are implemented by scikit-learn tool and some python packages. Run them in Anaconda3 (Spyder) platform. The signal processing methods and localization models are implemented by matlab R2014a.
